Actively investing (recently active filters)
Focused on their specific stage and sector
Within their geographic preference or target check size
Key Value Propositions They're Seeking
Personal Emails for VCs (not just generic fund emails)
"How to Approach" Guides - Investment thesis, what excites them, red flags to avoid
Connections via Portfolio Founders - LinkedIn profiles of recently funded founders for warm intro requests
Smart Filtering - Natural language search ("B2B SaaS investors in NYC doing Series A")
Database Scale - Access to 19,300+ funds worldwide

Has pitched before but struggled with response rates
Uses tools like Crunchbase, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, or investor spreadsheets

Summary
The ideal customer is a first-time or second-time founder at an early-stage startup who lacks deep VC connections and needs to efficiently identify, research, and approach the right investors with personalized outreach strategies.
